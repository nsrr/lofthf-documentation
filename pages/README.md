## About
The Impact of Low Flow Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy on Hospital Admissions and Mortality in Patients With Heart Failure and Central Sleep Apnea (LOFT-HF) Trial was an NHLBI-funded, multi-site, double-blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial that evaluated the long-term effects of Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy (NOXT) on the mortality and morbidity of adult patients 21 or older with stable heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), already receiving optimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), who have central sleep apnea (CSA), conducted from 2019 to 2022; the trial was prematurely ended due to low enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset includes administrative, anthropometry, demographic, questionnaire, clinical, oxygen adherence, and polysomnography data from 174 consented participants, including 98 randomized participants. The primary outcomes are the first occurrence of either mortality due to any cause, a life-saving CV intervention, or an unplanned hospitalization for worsening HF. Secondary outcomes included morbidity and mortality, quality of life and symptoms, and functional status. Participants were identified from cardiology and sleep clinical settings. Prior to randomization, CSA eligibility was determined based on central scoring of a clinically obtained sleep study within 6 months prior to randomization. If not available, an unattended Type 2 polysomnogram (Nox Medical A1 PSG), modified to allow for self-applied frontal EEGs, was obtained.

## Methods
### Recruitment and Eligibility:
Participants were recruited from 26 participating sites between Sept 2019 and June 2021 (overlapping the Covid 19 pandemic). Inclusion criteria included age ≥ 21 years, history of chronic, stable HFrEF with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%, central sleep apnea defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 15/h with ≥ 50% central events, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV, or NYHA Class II with specific additional criteria. Exclusion criteria included current positive airway pressure use, oxygen saturation < 90% at rest during the day, chronic daytime or nighttime use of supplemental oxygen, and other specific conditions.
•	Interventions: Participants received either sham or oxygen concentrators (Philips-Respironics Everflo Concentrator) with humidifiers and remote monitoring capabilities. Sham devices were configured to produce the same flow rates as oxygen concentrators. The initial plan was to titrate oxygen flow using remote oximetry monitoring over several nights with flow rates of 1 to 4 liters per minute (LPM). This procedure proved to be cumbersome, so early in the trial both groups were assigned to receive air or oxygen at 3LPM.
•	Adherence was monitored using a cloud-monitoring platform that continuously recorded flow rates and hours of concentrator use (Philips-Respironics Care Orchestrator cloud-based patient management solution). Study coordinators contacted participants when adherence was low to troubleshoot barriers to use, and encouraged device use through motivational enhancement techniques adapted from materials used for CPAP.
•	Clinical Endpoints: Potential clinical endpoints were adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Endpoints Committee based on medical records and patient/partner reported information.

### Clinic Visits/Data Collection: 
Study procedures were conducted in 98 randomized participants at Screening, Baseline, 1M, 3M, 9M, 18M follow-up phone calls, and 6M and 12M follow-up visits, and then every 6 months until study stop, at which time a Final Assessment was made. At Screening, patients were consented, their medical history and demographic information were collected, along with a medication review, assessment of their NYHA class, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and an initial PSG recording was collected. At Baseline, medical history, medication review, sleep questionnaires (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), EQ-5D, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), and PROMIS-Sleep Related Impairment 8a and PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 8a scales) were administered, and participants were randomized, provided sleep education, and home study therapy delivery was arranged. Each follow-up phone call (1M, 3M, 9M, 18M+) included medication review, adherence to concentrator use, clinical outcomes, and adverse event assessments were made. At follow-up visits (6M and 12M), in addition to measures completed at phone visits, the sleep questionnaires, NHYA assessment, and medical history/physical exams were repeated. At a final de-briefing visit, participants completed a patient satisfaction survey prior to being told which arm to which they had been randomized.

### Polysomnography (PSG) Collection: 
Participants either participated in a clinically obtained sleep study within 6 months of randomization, or if not available, an unattended Type 2 polysomnogram (Nox Medical A1 PSG) was obtained. Prior to closure of the study, active participants were asked to undergo a repeat unattended Type 2 polysomnogram using their assigned therapy. Signal channels from unattended Type 2 PSGs available in NSRR include respiratory movement, oximetry, position, snore, cannula flow, airflow, e1-e4, e2-e3, af3-e4, af4-e3, af7-e4, af8-e3, LF-RA, LA-RA, LF-LA. Studies from sites were either downloaded from the Nox software or copies of the clinical studies obtained and were securely transferred to the Sleep Reading Center (SRC) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at BWH reviewed studies for failure rates and quality of studies (graded according to the duration of artifact-free data on each channel), and sites were contacted with information regarding sleep study quality.

### Polysomnography (PSG) Scoring: 
Studies were scored at the BWH SRC using Noxtural scoring software, with use of Compumedics ProFusion PSG 3 V 3.4 Build 345 for some studies. An automatic analysis and scoring of the signals were performed. The signals were manually reviewed by a polysomnography technician following a detailed scoring MOP and annotated to provide sleep staging and respiratory event classification. The signals were reviewed and graded for quality issues, and reports were generated. EEG was staged in 30-second epochs according to AASM Version 2.5 scoring rules, with modifications made reflecting the exclusive use of frontal EEG signals.
-   **Sleep stages** - EEG was staged in 30-second epochs according to AASM Version 2.5 scoring rules, with modifications made reflecting the exclusive use of frontal EEG signals.
-   **Apneas** - The primary signal for scoring apneas was the unfiltered nasal cannula. Criteria for apneas included both: a) A drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥90% of pre-event baseline using the nasal pressure transducer (labeled mask pressure in the Noxturnal software) or an alternative apnea sensor; b) The duration of the ≥90% drop in sensor signal is ≥10 seconds. Identification of an apnea does not require a minimum desaturation criterion. Apneas were subtyped as Obstructive, Central, and Mixed.
-   **Obstructive Apneas** - An apnea was scored as obstructive if it met apnea criteria and was associated with inspiratory effort suggesting obstructive pathology for more than half of the period of no flow.
-   **Central Apneas** - An apnea was scored as central if it met apnea criteria and was associated with absent inspiratory effort or ≥ 90% reduced inspiratory effort on both bands (relative to baseline) throughout the period of absent flow.
-   **Mixed Apneas** - An apnea was scored as mixed if it met apnea criteria (>10 sec with absent or ≥90% reduced flow) and was associated with absent inspiratory effort for at least 10 seconds during the initial portion of the event, followed by evidence of obstruction or inspiratory efforts in the second portion of the event, but the obstruction occurs for less than half of the duration of the event.
-   **Hypopneas** - A respiratory event was scored as a hypopnea if ALL of the following criteria were met: a) The peak signal excursions dropped by ≥30% of pre-event baseline using nasal pressure (labeled mask pressure channel) or an alternative sensor; b) The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion was ≥10 seconds; c) There was a ≥3% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline or associated with an EEG arousal. Hypopneas were classified as obstructive or central.
-   **Obstructive Hypopneas** - Hypopneas were classified as obstructive if ANY of the following occur for a majority ( ≥ 75%) of the event duration: a) Snoring visible by fluttering on the nasal pressure channel (filtered or unfiltered) on the inspiratory portion during the event; b) Increased inspiratory flattening of the nasal pressure (labeled mask pressure channel) compared to baseline breathing; c) Associated thoracoabdominal paradox that occurred during the event but not during pre-event breathing.
-   **Central Hypopneas** - Hypopneas were classified as central if the effort on each of the bands showed in phase movements and all of the following occur for no more than 25% of the event duration: a) Snoring during the event (fluttering on the nasal pressure signal (labeled as mask pressure channel) or prominent audio; b) Increased inspiratory flattening of the nasal pressure (mask pressure) compared to baseline breathing.
